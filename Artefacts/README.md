# Inference Visual Results (Post-Training Validation)

These images were generated by running the trained YOLO model
(`Trained_model/best.pt`) in Google Colab after training.

Pipeline:
1. Excel file with latitude & longitude
2. Satellite image fetched in Colab
3. YOLO model inference
4. Bounding boxes drawn on rooftops

Green boxes indicate detected rooftop solar panels.
